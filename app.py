    input_df = pd.DataFrame([input_data])

    # IMPORTANT: Ensure the columns are in the same order as the training data (X_train)
    # The original training script's `predict_custom` function used `df_input[X_train.columns]`.
    # To replicate this, we need the exact column names and their order from the training.
    # Based on the training script's `X = df_encoded.iloc[:,1:]`, the columns are:
    # 'Pclass', 'Age', 'Fare', 'Family', 'Sex_male', 'Embarked_Q', 'Embarked_S'
    # We explicitly define this order to ensure consistency.
    expected_columns = ['Pclass', 'Age', 'Fare', 'Family', 'Sex_male', 'Embarked_Q', 'Embarked_S']

    # Reindex the input DataFrame to match the training data's column order
    # Any missing columns (e.g., if we had more Embarked categories and drop_first=False)
    # would be filled with NaN by default, which is then handled by XGBoost.
    # However, since we explicitly create all expected one-hot encoded columns,
    # this step primarily ensures correct ordering.
